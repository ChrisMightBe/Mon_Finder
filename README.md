## Mon Finder  

*This is a search function for pokemon*   

  
  While playing Pokemon games and fangames, I have ran into the issue of all resources being difficult for me to find the information I need.  
  My idea was to create a resource that will give me only the information I am looking for, so here we are  
  
*Uses https://pokeapi.co/ for the data*  
**Might change to my own dataset when I get around to building a scraper for a website with free use for personal projects, will remove this line if ever done**

As mentioned above, I took on this project as I have been playing a lot of Pok√©mon games, and wanted a resource where all the info i needed was displayed concisely, as most pre existing resources contain a lot of information I feel I dont need while playing  

I decided on web dev for this project as I feel  my college web dev grades are sub standard, and I wanted to prove I understand the concepts in web dev  

In the future I intend to make some sort of fullstack application to fully supplement my grades, and will remove this line when I have completed said project  

I referred to my web dev assignments and had copilot do code reviews. I looked to friends to review the UX if the site  

- API integration
- CSS usage at a higher level than college work
- More detailed JavaScript than the assignements at this level
